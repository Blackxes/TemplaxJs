# HTML template parser (vX.X.X)

You may want to use it - but im still not 100% sure about the structure might
rebuild reveral parts of this framework.

The versioning is respected. So when you update to another version its save based
on the version type. See [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

Since this framework is as far as i know not used at all by someone im still testing around.
If you someone managed to get here and are interested in using it, message me.

How this framework works can be seen and adopted by the code in "test/".
